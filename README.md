A site to playback sections of an mp3 file for practicing / transcribing !

A ripoff of [this windows program "BestPractice"](https://bestpractice.sourceforge.net/#contact) that I used as a 14 year old trumpet player for 100s of hours to learn songs on piano etc.

  - I thought this was gonna be way harder. Web rules.

### Future Ideas

- Seek bar replaced with waveform. Click on waveform to set playback position. Would help find the beginning of a measure / downbeat.
